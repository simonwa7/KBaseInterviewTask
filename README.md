# KBaseInterviewTask

This project is a designed as a programming task to display election donation information 
for presidential candidates during the 2015-2016 election. The main page displays a histogram
of the donations by committees to candidates with possible increased modularity to display 
other data sets.

Resulting from the intricate nature of these data sets, this program is designed to read in
specific file types from http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#a2015_2016. 

This project is built using Angular 6 as a front end framework and the d3.js library for
data visualization.
